When implementing CSS styling for a Next.js application:

3. Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach
4. Use CSS variables for consistent colors, spacing, and typography
5. Ensure proper color contrast for accessibility (WCAG AA minimum)

7. Use semantic HTML elements for better accessibility
8. Test responsive design at multiple breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
